# Shodan API Simplfied

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

This project is adds functionality to a basic use of the Shodan API (NOT the shodan cli), allowing for structured input and repeatability.

You can add this program to PATH so you can call it from the CLI, renaming it to a shorter name would be best if you do this - Also, make sure you're in a directory where you don't mind having files saved or modify code so that you can save/open the files from wherever you please.

## Usage
* Run the script with python
* ex. python shodan_ip_port_info.py
* Enter your shodan API key when prompted
* Follow prompts to choose options

## Output:
    1. Run the python file and enter your API

    1.1. If your API key is stored in the directory in the file shodan_api.json - you can go straight to the program

** If you have reset your API key, you will have to delete shodan_api.json to input your new API key....for now.

    2. Data from your searches will be saved in the file directory.
